# DeepLearning
self project with using Tensorflow and Keras


Multi-class classification with image data and text data 

1. Image Data

- Classifying art images into their categories. 5 different categories
- Art images are collected from wikiart.com
- First implemented Keras deep learning model from scratch
- Second implemented Keras deep learning model using VGG16

2. Text Data

- Classifying article text data into 5 different categories.
- Used text data from BBC.
  (1) Simple_text_classification.py
  - Used Keras pre-processing
  - Used Keras models
  
  (2) bbc_text_classification.py
  - Used BERT for pre-processing: Transfer Learning
  - Used Lime to show visual analysis for mis-classified texts
